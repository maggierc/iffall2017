            <p class="verse">
              She can say in her voice, in her way that she love me<br>
              With her eyes, with her smile, with her belt, with her hands, with her money<br>
              I am the thesis of her prayers<br>
              Her nieces and her nephews are just pieces of the layers<br>
              Only ones she love as much as me is Jesus Christ and Taylor<br>
              I got a feature so I'm singing for my grandma<br>
              You singing too, but your grandma ain't my grandma<br>
              Mine's is handmade, pan-fried, sun-dried<br>
              Southside, and beat the devil by a landslide<br>
              Praying with her hands tight, president of my fan club, Santa<br>
              Something told me I should bring my butt to church<br>
            </p>

              You gotta move it slowly<br>
              Take and eat my body like it's holy<br>
              I've been waiting for you for the whole week<br>
              I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy<br>

            Come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain<br>
            Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain<br>

            I come to church for the candy, your peppermints is the truth<br>
            I'm pessimistic on Monday if I had tweaked and missed you<br>
            You look so good with that hat on, had to match with the shoes<br>
            Came and dressed in the satin, I came and sat in your pew<br>
            I come to Christmas for dinner, fifty rolls on my plate<br>
            Hella holes in my stocking holding your pockets in place<br>
            I like my love with a budget, I like my hugs with a scent<br>
            You smell like light, gas, water, electricity, rent<br>
            You sound like why the gospel choir got so tired<br>
            Singin' his praises daily basis so I gotta try it<br>
            You're my dreamcatcher, dream team, team captain<br>
            Matter fact, I ain't seen you in a minute let me take my butt to church<br>
