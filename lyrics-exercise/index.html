        Yeah, yeah oh <br>
        Yeah, yeah yeah <br>
        <br>
        That's the way everyday goes <br>
        Every time we have no control <br>
        If the sky is pink and white <br>
        If the ground is black and yellow <br>
        It's the same way you showed me <br>
        Nod my head, don't close my eyes <br>
        Half way on a slow move <br>
        It's the same way you showed me <br>
        If you could fly then you'd feel south <br>
        Up north's getting cold soon<br>
        The way it is, we're on land<br>
        So I'm someone to hold true<br>
        Keep you cool in this good life<br>
        Won't let you down when it's all ruined<br>
      </div>

      <div class="chorus">
        Just the same way you showed me, showed me<br>
        You showed me love<br>
        Glory from above<br>
        Good Glory, dear<br>
        It's all downhill from here<br>
      </div>

      <div class="verse2">
        In the wake of a hurricane<br>
        Dark skin of a summer shade<br>
        Nose dive in the flood lines<br>
        Tall tower, milk crate<br>
        It's the same way you showed me<br>
        Cannon ball off the porch side<br>
        Older kids trying off the roof<br>
        Just the same way you showed me (you showed)<br>
        If you could die and come back to life<br>
        Up for air from the swimming pool<br>
        You kneel down to the dry land<br>
        Kiss the Earth that birthed you<br>
        Gave you tools just to stay alive<br>
        And make it up when the sun is ruined<br>
      </div>

      <div class="chorus">
        That's the same way you showed me, showed me<br>
        You showed me love<br>
        Glory from above<br>
        Where God could fear<br>
        It's all downhill from here<br>
      </div>

        What a life, remember how it was, climb trees, Michael Jackson, all in shit<br>
        (We've come) Say what up to Magic, just shoot<br>
        Say what up to daddy<br>
        Say what up to life, I found it<br>
        And I know what you might want to know<br>
        Run from me and your team<br>
        Still ain't grabbin six (take it easy)<br>
        Give me somethin sweet<br>
        Bitch I might bite, ain't no tellin<br>
        This is life, life immortality<br>
