    <h1>Feedback for Carissa</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Aesthetic</li>
          <ul>
            <li>obvious concept, the postcards feel cohesive and consistent</li>
            <li>type is legible</li>
            <li>cropping is good on all image formats</li>
          </ul>
      <li>Structure</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Visual priorities are the person's face and the quote</li>
            <li>Elements are working in complement</li>
            <li>Bottom two will be easier to accomodate browser width. First card might be more challenging because of how the two texts wrap the face</li>
          </ul>
      <li>Technical Challenges</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Images look good / cropping is considered </li>
            <li>The Ryan Gosling image looks a little lower resolution than the other ones (ragged edges on the coat / hair)</li>
            <li>Look straightforward to build, I don't see any areas where the text would become illegible on the images. As long as it's coded so that the text never overlaps the face, it should work fine!</li>
            <li>I might make the font size a little smaller, just so you have more wiggle room with the margins (especially on the Lochte / Reynolds' desktop versions)</li>
          </ul>
