        <h2>SLOW MOVEMENT</h2>
        <p>Slow fashion, the alternative to fast fashion and part of what has been called the "slow movement", advocates for principles similar to the principles of slow food, which are:</p>

        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Good: quality, flavorsome and healthy food</li>
            <li>Clean: production that does not harm the environment</li>
            <li>Fair: accessible prices for consumers and fair conditions and pay for producers</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>The expression "slow fashion" was coined in a 2007 article by Kate Fletcher published in The Ecologist, where she compared the eco/sustainable/ethical fashion industry to the slow food movement:

        <q cite="">The concept of slow fashion borrows heavily from the Slow Food Movement. Founded by Carlo Petrini in Italy in 1986, Slow Food links pleasure and food with awareness and responsibility. It defends biodiversity in our food supply by opposing the standardisation of taste, defends the need for consumer information and protects cultural identities tied to food. It has spawned a wealth of other slow movements. Slow Cities, for example, design with slow values but within the context of a town or city and a commitment to improve its citizens' quality of life.</q></p>

        <p>Some elements of the slow fashion philosophy include: buying vintage clothes, redesigning old clothes, shopping from smaller producers, making clothes and accessories at home and buying garments that last longer. New ideas and product innovations are constantly redefining slow fashion, so using a static, single definition would ignore the evolving nature of the concept.</p>

        <p>Unlike fast fashion, slow fashion production ensures quality manufacturing to lengthen the life of the garment. Slow fashion may be considered a revolt or action against the fast fashion movement. Developing a garment with a cultural and emotional connection is also pertinent to the purpose behind slow fashion: consumers will keep an article of clothing longer than one season if they feel emotionally or culturally connected to the article of clothing. A taxation is in early stages of development in order to deter fashion companies from purchasing or producing materials that are not made with recycled, organic, or re-purposed materials. Utilizing materials already made will reduce the industry's carbon footprint.</p>

          <p>There is also an important movement towards companies being more transparent. The need for companies to show their manufacturing processes boosts the companies reputation and can aid buyers to making more conscious decisions. In accordance with the slow movement there is a trend towards more conscious buying as well as companies attracting new consumers with their eco-friendly processes. Consumers still need to do their research into companies as some of them use the idea of eco-fashion without fully backing it up.</p>

          <p>Although price is sometimes a deterrent for purchasing slow fashion items, in the long run, one piece of well designed and well produced clothing will outlive five cheap pieces of clothing. Generally, the more a person spends on their clothes, the more value the item will hold (see empathic design below). It makes the piece more special and therefore will make the person feel better about what they wear. Slow fashion clothing is made up of high quality materials usually with timeless designs that can be worn year round and never go out of style. Slow fashion garments should also consider their end of lifecycle. Generally if it is well made and with natural fibers it can be broken down easier. One current problem with the fast fashion industry is the amount of waste generated into landfills.</p>

          <p>The slow fashion movement has been studied by Kate Fletcher, a researcher, author, consultant, and design activist, and the author of Sustainable Fashion and Textiles. Her writings integrated design thinking with fashion and textiles as a necessary way to move towards a more sustainable fashion industry.</p>

          <h2>Empathic Design</h2>
          <p>Empathic design is a concept that is a part of user-centered design aiming to promote a deeper connection to the consumer, making it important to integrate it with slow fashion. This can be done by understanding the consumers' needs, values, and emotions. A special meaning must be associated with the product or its use to inspire deeper attachment. Focusing on positive product experience can also result in product or brand attachment which can be broken down into three levels: visceral, behavioral, and reflective. The visceral component has to do with first impressions and first impressions. Human behavior is about how consumers interact with environments and objects, taking into consideration an objects pleasure and effectiveness. Enzo Manzini, a design thinker said there is a need to understand behavior and the underlying reasons for their consumptions in order to direct their consumptions towards more sustainable alternatives. The reflective level deals with personal attachment based on an individual's memories and experiences. It can consist of feelings, emotions, self-image, personal satisfaction, memories and cognition.[10]</p>
