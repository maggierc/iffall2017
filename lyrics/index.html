                  She can say in her voice, in her way<br>
                  that she love me<br>
                  With her eyes, with her smile, with her belt, with her hands, with her money<br>
                  I am the thesis of her prayers<br>
                  Her nieces and her nephews<br>
                  are just pieces of the layers<br>
                  Only ones she love as much as me <br>
                  is Jesus Christ and Taylor<br>
                  I got a feature so I'm singing for my grandma<br>
                  You singing too, but your grandma ain't my grandma<br>
                  Mine's is handmade, pan-fried, sun-dried<br>
                  Southside, and beat the devil by a landslide<br>
                  Praying with her hands tight, president of my fan club, Santa<br>

                      I come to church for the candy,<br>
                      your peppermints is the truth<br>
                      I'm pessimistic on Monday <br>
                      if I had tweaked and missed you<br>
                      You look so good with that hat on, <br>
                      had to match with the shoes<br>
                      Came and dressed in the satin, <br>
                      I came and sat in your pew<br>
                      I come to Christmas for dinner, fifty rolls on my plate<br>
                      Hella holes in my stocking holding your pockets in place<br>
                      I like my love with a budget, I like my hugs with a scent<br>
                      You smell like light, gas, water, electricity, rent<br>
                      You sound like why the gospel choir got so tired<br>
                      Singin' his praises daily basis so I gotta try it<br>
                      You're my dreamcatcher, dream team, team captain<br>
                      Matter fact, I ain't seen you in a minute <br>
                      let me take my butt to church<br>
