                    She can say in her voice, in her way<br>
                    that she love me<br>
                    With her eyes, with her smile, with her belt,<br>
                    with her hands, with her money<br>
                    I am the thesis of her prayers<br>
                    Her nieces and her nephews<br>
                    are just pieces of the layers<br>

                    I come to church for the candy,<br>
                    your peppermints is the truth<br>
                    I'm pessimistic on Monday <br>
                    if I had tweaked and missed you<br>
                    You look so good with that hat on, <br>
                    had to match with the shoes<br>
                    Came and dressed in the satin, <br>
                    <span class="emphasized">I came and sat in your pew</span><br>
                    I come to Christmas for dinner, <br>
                    fifty rolls on my plate<br>
                    Hella holes in my stocking <br>
                    holding your pockets in place<br>
                    I like my love with a budget, <br>I
                    like my hugs with a scent<br>
                    You smell like light, gas, water, electricity, <span class="emphasized">rent</span><br>

                    You sound like why the gospel choir got so tired<br>
                    Singin' his praises daily basis so I gotta try it<br>
                    You're my dreamcatcher, <br>
                    dream team, team captain<br>
                    Matter fact, I ain't seen you in a minute <br>
